## Things I care about

1. **Uber and Grab Drivers advancing their education** through podcast materials that can be redistributed via bluetooth rather than WiFi, because internet usage is expensive in 3rd world countries.

2. Dungeons and dragons as a creative outlet and a safe sandbox for young and old players alike to **learn character development**.
