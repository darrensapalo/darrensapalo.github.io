                    <h1>So what?</h1>
                    <p>
                        It's great that people are fascinated with technology such as <em>Uber</em>, <em>Facebook</em>, and games like <em>Clash Royale</em>. There's so much more to learn about the Internet!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>People feel the relevance of technology and the internet because they've felt its impact on their everyday lives.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My point is: As Uber drivers, you listen to different things in the radio such as news, the top songs for the week, and sometimes True Love Conversations.</p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of all of that, <strong>why not spend your time learning something from the Internet?</strong>

                        Yes. That's right. You can actually use the internet to learn. What's challenging for you as an Uber driver is that <strong>you don't have time to read on your phone.</strong> You're driving, right?

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        That's okay, you can <strong>use Podcasts to listen to books, lectures, discussions instead of reading them!</strong>

                        You know how radio stations invite people to talk about things? They might have a doctor as a guest speaker so that they can talk about how to stay healthy, avoid Diabetes, and dealing with hypertension.

                    <h3>Now imagine that you can pick exactly what you want to listen to, instead of whatever is on the radio station.</h3>

                    <p>
                        That's what Podcasts are. They're pre-recorded and saved; You only need to find what you're interested in and download them.

                        While you're using Podcasts, you might encounter these questions:

                        <h4>Will this consume a lot of data on my data plan?</h4>
                        <p>
                        <text class="bg-danger">Be warned! <strong>YES, this will consume a lot of data.</strong></text> It will use up battery on your device while you're downloading it too. If you're using a data plan that has a data cap (i.e. gives you only 300 MB or 900MB), be wary because <text class="bg-danger">you might end up not having enough data to use the Uber app</text>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Why does the download take so long?</h4>
                        <p>
                        These downloads take really long because they download 20 minutes to over 60 minutes of audio content. For example, I downloaded a 53 minute lecture on Computer Science which takes up 118.24MB. It's just something you have to wait for. You can try downloading them over night so they're ready for tomorrow.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The downloads don't finish. What do I do?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Sadly, our internet data services such as PLDT, Smart, and Globe aren't the best. Just try to resume the downloads when you can.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If things still don't work out, try finding something smaller to download.
